How to Use 2-matrix_divided.py
===========================
This module defines a function `matrix_divided(matrix, div)` that divides all elements
of a matrix by a given number.

Usage
=====
`matrix_divided(matrix, div)` returns a new matrix where all elements have been divided by `div`
and rounded to 2 decimal places.

    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

    >>> matrix = [[-1, -2, -3], [-4, -5, -6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, -3)
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Each row of the matrix must have the same size.

    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

`matrix` must be a list of lists of integers or floats.

    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, "3"], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Dividing by Zero
================
If `div` is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` will be raised.

    >>> matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Dividing by Infinity
====================
When `div` is infinity (`float('inf')`), all elements in the matrix should become `0.0`.

    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, float('inf'))
    [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]]


`div` must be a number (integer or float).

    >>> matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, "two")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be a number

Matrix with Floats
==================
The function works with matrices that contain floats, and all results are rounded to 2 decimal places.

    >>> matrix = [[1.5, 2.5], [3.5, 4.5]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 1.5)
    [[1.0, 1.67], [2.33, 3.0]]

Handling Large Numbers
======================
The function works with large numbers and properly rounds them.

    >>> matrix = [[1000, 2000], [3000, 4000]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 1000)
    [[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]
